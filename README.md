# GeoFlashcards
 Printable PDF flashcards of all 193+2 countries with flag+map in the front and important data in the back.
 Run python renderer.py and go to http://127.0.0.1:5000/back/ or http://127.0.0.1:5000/front or http://127.0.0.1:5000/complete to re-render with the browser. 
 Only Chrome manages to cut off properly the pages, and you have to print odd pages only because it adds a white page after the break (the white page also makes macOS preview render random gray stuff in the flashcards)
 
 Very very aggressive margins for printing on A4, you might need to scale back but be careful to so as it might screw up horizontal alignment between front and back.

 Flags data from flagpedia.net and maps from Wikimedia. Watch out â€“ the entire repo is about 4.5 gigabytes because it includes a *lot* of SVGs, even for territories that are not included in the pdfs.
 If you just want to download the PDFs, just head to the releases.
